# Logistic Regression - March Madness Predictor

In this repository, I predicted the outcomes of certain matchups in March 
Madness based on data provided by Merkle.  Using Logistic Regression (as 
well as experimenting with other machine learning algorithms), I achieved 
an accuracy of predicting 76% of games accurately.

Run the python notebook March-Madness-03062018-Experimenting-76%.ipynb
to see results.
